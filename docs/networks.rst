Networks
********

Networks are an abstraction of a grouping of nengo objects (Nodes, Ensembles, 
Connections). Like all abstractions, this helps with code-reuse and 
maintainability. You'll find the documentation for the various pre-built networks
below, but obviously you are encouraged to build your own.
